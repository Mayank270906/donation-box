# üéÅ Donation Box Contract
## üìú Project Description
This project is a decentralized **donation platform** built using the Clarity smart contract language and deployed on the **Stacks blockchain**. The smart contract enables individuals and organizations to collect STX donations in a fully transparent and trustless manner. Every donation is recorded on-chain, creating an immutable record of contributions while allowing donors to remain pseudonymous through their wallet addresses.

The contract handles donation collection, contributor tracking, and fund withdrawal ‚Äî all without requiring any centralized payment processors or intermediaries.

## üî≠ Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to **democratize fundraising and charitable giving** on the blockchain. By building a transparent donation system, we aim to:

* Enable trustless charitable giving where donors can verify fund usage on-chain.
* Eliminate intermediaries and reduce fees associated with traditional donation platforms.
* Provide transparency that builds donor confidence and accountability.
* Create a foundation for more sophisticated crowdfunding and charitable mechanisms.
* Support causes, creators, and organizations through direct peer-to-peer donations.
